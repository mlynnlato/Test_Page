                <p>This lab will exercise your ability to implement a software state machine to control the train. You
                    will create custom functions to represent each state, use enumerations to define custom data types,
                    and create structures for holding all of the state machine's inputs. You will also import a custom
                    library for writing to the SSD. You will not need to understand how the interface works, only how to
                    use the library.</p>
